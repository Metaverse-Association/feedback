# feedback
The feedback channel for those participating in the Metaverse Association fund ecosystem. 

The purpose of this repo would be solely for making suggestions, giving feedback, and discussing integration blockers/needs/successes. Github actually has their own [github/feedback](https://github.com/github/feedback) repo, which can be searched, tagged, etc. 

We already leverage the holistic backlog, which lets us syndicate tickets from all of our active repos. This means, we could have a feedback channel, and the group can select to pull in, or defer, items of feedback into our holistic backlog. Effectively "activating" that piece of work. 

I think this could help newcomers find answers to common questions, and provide a new inlet for the most important element of iteration - feedback! 

The repo would look like [this](https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions):
